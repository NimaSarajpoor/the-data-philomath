Not all notes are meant to be for others. This is one of those. This is an attempt to write down my thoughts on the roadmap I am planning for myself for the next three months.


I would like to enter a serious company that does financial investment, or a tech-heavy company. I think there are certain skills I need to improve:

(1) Advanced coding skills: 
    - Funademntals 
    - Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Profiling and Optimization
    - System Design

(2) Financial Knowledge:
    - Financial Markets and Instruments
    - Investment Strategies
    - Risk Management
    - Financial Modeling


Now, let's take a look at some of the books that MIGHT be helpful:

- Data Structures and Programming Design Using Python (Bradley N. Miller, David L. Ranum)
- Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (D. Malhotra)
- Acing the system design interview (Zhiyong Tan)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmann)
